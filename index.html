Her father is African, but we are from the same Mother. So it's making her my half Sister. But, it doesn't matter.<br>
I love her as my blood, because, she Is.

<h3 class="BigFont">My Sister And I</h3>
<P class="BigFont">When I was little we always liked the same things:
<ul class="BigFont">
<li>shopping</li>
<li>hang out with friends</li>
<li>listening to the same music </li>
<li>Watching Disney Movies(pixar)</li>
</ul>
</P>

<p class="BigFont">When I was 7 we went to The Mall, we went shopping. we spent hours and hours between different clothes stores, I had to wait until she tries all the clothes,<br>
it was so tiring, I almost dozed off.<br>
After she finished choosing the clothes she wanted from some of the stores, we finally went out to grub something to eat. I of course held the bags.<br>
When we finally exited The Mall and we were on the bus. We noticedI forgot The bags at The Mall. A bag full of expensive clothing. We went back, The bag wasn't there.<br>
Until today she remembers that for me...
</p>

<h4 class="BigFont">Her Achivements</h4>
<p class="BigFont">Vick, I am so proud her, She finished 4 years of Law School and got a permit, this is why and it was so hard for her.<br>
But, she finished it like boss.<br>
My sister always keeps me safe,<br>like a lioness and her cub, she never gives up on me when times got hard,
or I try to give up on something,<br> she will not let me.<br>
Thst's the main reasones I love her.
